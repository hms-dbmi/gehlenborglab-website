The HIDIVE Lab develops computational tools that enable data-driven biomedical research, with a focus on visualization and exploration of genomics and epigenomics data. Currently, the lab is researching and developing novel tools to visualize heterogeneous data from large-scale cancer genomics and genome conformation studies, integration of visual and computational approaches to support sense-making in biology, and software to support reproducible research for biomedical applications. Research is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Cancer Institute, the NIH Common Fund, and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.
