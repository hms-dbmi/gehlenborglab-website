The [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org) is a consortium composed of diverse research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health. HuBMAP is committed to developing the next generation of molecular analysis technologies, computational tools, and to generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the construction of an atlas of the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function.

Our lab is contributing the [data portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org) user interfaces as well as various visualization tools and data curation to this highly collaborative projects. Details about software and other resources are available on our [project page](/research/projects/hubmap).
