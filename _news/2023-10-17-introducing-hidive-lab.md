We are thrilled to announce an exciting transformation. After careful consideration and thoughtful deliberation, we are renaming the Gehlenborg Lab to HIDIVE Lab (Humans in Data Integration, Visualization, and Exploration). This change represents our dedication to human-centric design and our focus on researching methods and designing software that make complex biomedical data more accessible, comprehensible, and actionable to all. 

Welcome to the HIDIVE Lab in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu) at [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu)!
