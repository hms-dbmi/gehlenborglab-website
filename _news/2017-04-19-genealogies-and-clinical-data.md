We are excited to share the results of another visualization project: [Lineage](https://lineage.caleydoapp.com). Lineage is a web-based tool for visualizing multivariate clinical data in genealogy graphs and was developed together with [Carolina Nobre](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/nobre/) and [Alexander Lex](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/lex/) from the [Visualization Design Lab](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) in the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah. A [preprint](/publications/nobre-2017-biorxiv-lineage/) that describes how we designed and implemented this tool is available on the [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/19/128579). A key contribution of this project is a novel technique to interactively visualize and aggregate large, tree-like graphs associated with rich numerical, categorical and textual attributes.

A demo version of [Lineage](https://lineage.caleydoapp.com) with 10 anonymized families from the Utah Population Database is available at [https://lineage.caleydoapp.com](https://lineage.caleydoapp.com).

See the website of the [Visualization Design Lab](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2017_preprint_lineage/) at the University of Utah for a video and more information about this project.
