We are excited to announce that our paper "Beyond Time and Accuracy: Strategies in Visual Problem-Solving" got accepted to CHI2025! Lead by Eric, we conducted an 1h in-lab study with over 50 participants using the Tobii Pro Eyetracking Equipment to better understand how people read visualizations und use them to answer questions. As far as we have seen this is one of the first papers combining multiple data streams, including eye tracking to analyze visual literacy in a diverse set of participants (the oldest participant was over 80 years old). Read more about this in our preprint [here](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/emydq_v1).
