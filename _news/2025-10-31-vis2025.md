We’re excited to attend [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome) this year in Vienna! Our lab is presenting four papers!

On Monday, during the VISxGenAI workshop, we are presenting two short papers. First, Devin Lange will present “A Generative AI System for Biomedical Data Discovery with Grammar-Based Visualizations”. Then, Skylar Sargent Walters will virtually present “GQVis: A Dataset of Genomics Data Questions and Visualizations for Generative AI”. 

On Thursday, we also have two papers. Huyen Nguyen will present the short paper “Safire: Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval”. David Kouřil will virtually present the full paper “Design Space and Declarative Grammar for 3D Genomic Data Visualization”.

We are very excited to share and discuss our work. We hope to see you there!
