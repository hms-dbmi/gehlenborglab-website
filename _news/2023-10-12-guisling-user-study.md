blurb: Participants wanted! Interviews on Genome-mapped Data Visualization 
---
Are you working with genomics data and regularly visualizing *Genome-mapped Data* for exploration, analysis, or presentation? We welcome you to participate in our interview study! 

The goal of this study is to better understand various workflows, needs, and challenges of any users who are visualizing these data. Participants receive a $25 Amazon Gift Card for a  1-hour interview. Details are given below.

**What is the purpose of this study?** Our goal is to understand various analysis and visualization workflows for genomics, specifically genome-mapped data (for example, data processing, visual analytics, and presentation).


**Who can participate?** Participants should have experience working with *Genome-mapped Data* (e.g., data process, visualization, and/or analysis), preferably on a weekly basis. They should have familiarity with Genome-mapped Data visualization tools like genome browsers (e.g., IGV, JBrowse, Circos). Participants may be graduate students, postdocs, researchers, clinicians, s/w engineers, and faculties.

<ul>
<li> <i>Genome-mapped Data</i> is any set of attributes that is mapped to genomic coordinates. Only when 
     genomic coordinates are displayed in a visualization, it is a <i>Genome-mapped Data</i> Visualization.</li>
</ul>

**What to expect?** The interview will take 1 hour. We will ask about your typical process for analyzing and visualizing your genome-mapped data. You will be asked to share the screenshots/figures of visualizations you commonly create and walk us through the process of creating those. After the interview and upon your interest, we may invite you for a follow-up study 2-4 weeks after this interview.  

**When and where?** This study will be conducted virtually on Zoom between <u>Oct 12 - Dec 22, 2023</u>. You can schedule at a time of your preference between 9 am -- 6 pm EST.

**How to participate?** To participate, please fill out our online [pre-study survey](https://forms.gle/vFawvaSpGZ9U8tzTA){:target="_blank"} ([https://forms.gle/vFawvaSpGZ9U8tzTA](https://forms.gle/vFawvaSpGZ9U8tzTA){:target="_blank"}). Upon completion, you will receive a Calendly link to select a time of your preference for the interview. We suggest you join Zoom using a computer you usually use for working with genome-mapped data so you can share your screen with us.

**Is there compensation?** We give out a $25 Amazon Digital Gift Card to everyone participating in the interviews.

**Who to contact for scheduling and questions?**
