The HIDIVE Lab at Harvard Medical School Department of Biomedical Informatics is thrilled to present the first in-person VUES (Visualization and User Experience Seminar) on Spatial Biology event at Harvard Medical School on Tuesday, March 11. Details and free registration on [https://vues.events/](https://vues.events/)!

The focus of this event is the generation, analysis, and visualization of 3D tissue maps, which promise to reveal new insights into tissue architectures and their biological significance in healthy and diseased organs.

We will have keynotes by [Peter Sorger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-sorger-47b32479/) and [Ashley Kiemen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleykiemen/) as well as talks on biological questions and data generation ([Gloria Pryhuber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloria-pryhuber-765172149/), Sanjay Jain, Melissa Farrow), data analysis and integration ([Clarence Yapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarence-yapp/), Matt Ruffalo, [Yuqi Tan, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuqitanphd/)), and data visualization and interaction ([Eric Moerth, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmoerth/), [Jakob Troidl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-troidl-32a425134/), Robert Kr√ºger).
