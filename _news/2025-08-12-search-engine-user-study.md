Are you a genomics researcher who works with genome-mapped data and visualizations?

We want to hear from you!

## What’s this about?

We’re developing a new search engine to help researchers easily find genomics visualizations and adapt them as customizable templates for their own projects, enabling a more efficient workflow for exploration and analysis. Your feedback will help us improve this tool and make it work better for scientists like you.

## Who can join?

Anyone with experience working with genome-mapped data and visualizations, including but not limited to:

- Graduate students & postdocs
- Faculty & clinicians
- Bioinformatics researchers
- Software engineers working with genomics data

_Genome-mapped data_ means your data is mapped to genomic coordinates. Only visualizations that display these coordinates are considered genome-mapped data visualizations. If this describes your work, you’re whom we’re looking for!

## What to expect?

- **Share your workflow**: We'd like to start by hearing about your usual genomics visualization workflow to understand your context of use.
- **Try our tool**: Get a guided walkthrough and hands-on demo.
- **Give us feedback**: Tell us what works, what doesn’t, and how it could fit into your work.

## Session details

- **Format**: The discussion will be informal and conversational. No preparation needed!
- **When & where**: In person at Countway Library or virtually via Zoom, August 13–15, 2025
- **Duration**: 30 minutes, scheduled at your convenience

## How to sign up?
It’s easy!

- [Schedule a session here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/207bf621b8654f8f991afe743c615e69@hms.harvard.edu/meetingtype/fWU50rGnvUWEHWqcLsxb5w2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=mlink).
