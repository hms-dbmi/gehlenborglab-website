blurb: Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2021 will feature a workshop on using user-centered design approaches to build computational biology tools.
---
Together with Mary Goldman from the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz, Nils will be running a workshop called "Making Tools that People Will Use: User-Centered Design in Computational Biology Research". The workshop will give an overview of user-centered design (UCD) and several examples of how UCD practices are already being used at several institutions in computational biology research. It will provide attendees with ideas of how to incorporate UCD into their tool development as well as general resources to get started. More information about the event is available on the [workshop website](https://ucd-in-compbio.github.io/psb-workshop/).
