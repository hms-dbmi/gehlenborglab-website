We are looking for new postdoctoral fellows to join the lab and to contribute to collaborative efforts that aim to advance our understanding of [nuclear dynamics through genomic and imaging data](/team/positions/postdoctoral-fellow-nucleomics-visualization/) and of [COVID-19 through electronic health record data](/team/positions/postdoctoral-fellow-ehr-data-visualization/). All positions have a strong focus on applied visualization research and tool building. The EHR project also has an educational component.

Please see our [Open Positions](/team/open-positions/) page for details on these positions.
