blurb: UpSetR is an open source R package that employs a scalable matrix-based visualization of sets.

Venn and Euler diagrams are a popular yet inadequate solution for quantitative visualization of set intersections. A scalable alternative to Venn and Euler diagrams for visualizing intersecting sets and their properties is needed. We developed UpSetR, an open source R package that employs a scalable matrix-based visualization to show intersections of sets, their size, and other properties. A preprint describing the R package has been posted to [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120600).

UpSetR itself is available at [https://cran.r-project.org/package=UpSetR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=UpSetR) and released under the MIT License. A Shiny app to generate UpSet plots is available at [https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr](https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr).
