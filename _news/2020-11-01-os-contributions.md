Our work in the Gehlenborg lab depends on open source software, but we also give back to the community,
and are contributors to several projects.
- Ilan Gold [extended Deck.gl's tiling](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ailan-gold)
  to work for non-geographic tile sets,
  and Viv is now featured in the [Deck.gl showcase](https://deck.gl/showcase).
- Trevor Manz [presented](https://forum.image.sc/t/upcoming-calls-on-next-gen-bioimaging-data-tools-starting-oct-29/43489/34)
  work on Viv recently at an OME meeting on next-generation file formats (NGFF),
  and has made a [lot of PRs to zarr.js](https://github.com/gzuidhof/zarr.js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amanzt).
- Open source isn't just about code. Chuck McCallum has contributed to the documentation of
  [Cypress.io](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/pull/195/files)
  and [Deck.gl](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amccalluc).
