image_alt: Two-by-two grid with sketches (top row) and schematics (bottom row). The columns are labeled ‘direct’ and ‘gradual’, and the rows are labeled ‘sketch’ and ‘mental model’. The direct sketch (A1) has two axes and a few black and colored vertical lines. The gradual sketch (B1) has two axes and colored letters (A, C, T, G) in it. The ‘mental models’ below (A2, B2) are neater versions of the sketches. The gradual charts are closer to a sequence logos plot than the direct charts.

## Overview
In this short project, we explored the idea of mental models of visualizations and methods of introducing new visualizations. Different studies in the visualization community show that using transitions to introduce a new visualization can be beneficial. Here, we explored whether that was also the case for someone who is blind. In these studies, animations are often used, and people rely heavily on visual elements. We wondered if this would still be a good approach when someone relies on text descriptions. 


## Highlights
- We used two approaches to introduce a novel visualization, the 'direct' and 'gradual' approach. In the 'direct' approach, we described the visualization directly by it's visual elements. In the 'gradual' approach, we constructed subsequent visualizations and described the visualization by describing the changing visual elements from each step.

- A blind individual read the descriptions with a screen reader and sketched the visual elements on a tablet.

- The gradual approach showed much potential for an easier understanding of a novel visualization.

- This work was presented during the [1st Workshop on Accessibile Data Visualization](https://accessviz.github.io) at [IEEE VIS 2024](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome).
