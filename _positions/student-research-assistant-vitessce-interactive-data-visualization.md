project:
  - vitessce

---
The [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org/) in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School invites applications for paid student research assistants.


#### Project Overview
Are you interested in developing interactive data visualization solutions that can be used to solve biological challenges? Join us as a student research assistant in the [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org/) at Harvard Medical School!


#### Responsibilities
You will have a chance to experience the process of developing interactive visualization tools for biological challenges. This work will build upon our existing tool called [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io/) and corresponding packages in R and Python. Your tasks will include:
- Processing single cell, spatial omics, and imaging data sets
- Writing computational pipelines, scripts, and tests to ensure reproducibility
- Creating Vitessce visualizations for published data sets
- Updating, extending, and maintaining the Vitessce R and Python packages
- Creating tutorials demonstrating best practices and features in Vitessce

Further details will be decided after discussing with your primary mentor.


#### Qualifications
- Self-motivated, responsive, willingness to learn
- Undergraduate or Masters student in computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, data science, or any other related fields
- You are expected to contribute between 10 and 14 hours a week
- You are expected to be familiar with either Python or R, and have programming experience.
- Knowledge of computational workflow management software (e.g., Snakemake, NextFlow, Common Workflow Language) is recommended but not required.
- Experience in web development, data visualization, human-computer interaction, bioinformatics, or biomedical data analysis is a big plus.
- This position can be either in-person or remote. You need to be based in CT, GA, IL, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA,VT, or WA to be on Harvard payroll.

#### Benefits
- This is a paid position with a standard hourly rate ($30/hour).
- You will receive mentorship from faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students in our lab in weekly meetings.
- You will receive hands-on training and develop skills and expertise in data visualization and bioinformatics.
