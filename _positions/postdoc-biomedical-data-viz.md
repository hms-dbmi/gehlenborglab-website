Join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers to shape the future of biomedical research! 

The HIDIVE Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is funded to develop data visualization tools and user interfaces for multiple national and international cell atlas projects such as the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org) (HuBMAP), the [Cellular Senescence Network](https://sennetconsortium.org) (SenNet), the [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org) (HTAN), the [Kidney Precision Medicine Network](https://www.kpmp.org/)(KPMP), the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA), and the [4D Nucleome Consortium](https://www.4dnucleome.org/) (4DN). Additionally, the lab is conducting research on novel biomedical data visualization methods for genomics and spatial single cell data with funding from institutions such as the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) and the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) (NHGRI). Most recently, the lab has begun research on generative AI for visual data discovery in biology and medicine with funding from the [ARPA-H Biomedical Data Fabric (BDF) Toolbox](https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/arpa-h-bdf-toolbox) Program and a Community Visualization Hub with funding from the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Program. In our work, we combine state-of-the-art biomedical informatics, data visualization, and AI/ML techniques across the full spectrum of biomedical data. An overview of recent publications of the lab can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YEcBVFAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

 
We currently have multiple positions available for postdoctoral researchers who want to contribute to our mission by leading research projects in one or more of the following areas:

- Generative AI for visual exploration of biomedical data repositories
- Mixed Reality for 2D and 3D tissue data visualization in spatial biology
- Communication and storytelling through biomedical data visualization
- Visualization of genome-mapped data (genomics, epigenomics, nucleomics, etc.)
- Multimodal single-cell data visualization
- 2D and 3D bioimaging data visualization
- Data analysis and data management infrastructure for biomedical data visualization

As a postdoctoral fellow in the lab, you will take a scientific leadership role and be in charge of one or more research projects. Under the mentorship of the PI, you will develop strategies for publishing and obtaining additional grant funding for your work.
You will also have the opportunity to mentor more junior lab members, to participate in teaching, and to take advantage of the many career development opportunities offered by the [Harvard Medical School Postdoc Office](https://postdoc.hms.harvard.edu) and other Harvard University resources.

You will also benefit from multiple research software products (e.g., [HiGlass](http://higlass.io); [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io); [Gosling](http://gosling-lang.org); [HuBMAP Data Portal User Interface](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org); etc.) that the lab has developed and maintains with the help of multiple professional software engineers. These products are used by individual scientists, consortia, and companies all over the world and can serve as a frameworks to implement and disseminate the outcomes of your research.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The HIDIVE Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!

#### Basic Requirements
Candidates must have a PhD degree in a computational field such as computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical informatics, medical informatics, or related fields and a track-record of publication in the top journals or conferences of their field. Hands-on experience with management, analysis, and visualization of biomedical data as well as experience in developing (web-based) interactive software tools are highly desired for these position. Excellent programming skills and working knowledge of state-of-the-art software development techniques are essential. Strong written and verbal communication skills are crucial.

#### Additional Requirements
Experience with Python or R, JavaScript, and web application development are expected. Cloud computing skills are desirable. Experience with research on extended/mixed/virtual reality techniques are strongly desired for some projects. Previous research experience with data from areas such as single-cell omics, spatial omics, genomics, epigenomics, nucleomics, or bioimaging are desirable but are not required.

#### Work Environment
The HIDIVE Lab is using a hybrid workplace model and this position can be fully remote, hybrid, or in-person. All remote work must be performed within a state in which Harvard is registered to do business (CA, CT, GA, IL, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, and WA). Occasional domestic or international travel to attend meetings may be required.

#### Terms
The positions are available immediately and can be renewed annually.

#### How to Apply
Candidates should submit their CV, a research statement, PDFs of their three best papers, and contact information for three references to [nils@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:nils@hms.harvard.edu) with [POSTDOC] in the subject.

*Harvard Medical School is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.*
