Join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers to shape the future of biomedical research! The HIDIVE Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School focuses on the role of humans–scientists, doctors, and patients–in making sense of complex data. We accomplish this by designing novel methods and building tools for data integration, visualization, and exploration.

The lab has recently received funding from the US government for a multi-year project to develop AI-driven data visualization tools and user interfaces for the exploration of large data repositories.

Your responsibility will be to ensure that the user experience and user interfaces for our tools meet the needs of a broad community of scientists, clinicians, and other stakeholders. You will accomplish this by applying state-of-the-art user research techniques to elicit personas, use cases, and evaluation criteria. You will create wireframes and high fidelity user interface mockups. You will partner with the software developers and researchers on our team as well as national and international collaborators to accomplish our goals. You will also coordinate with the day-to-day work of other UI/UX designers on the team and develop processes and documentation for UI/UX design work in the HIDIVE Lab.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The HIDIVE Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!
