Join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers to shape the future of biomedical research! 
 
The Gehlenborg Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is funded to develop data visualization tools and user interfaces for multiple national and international cell atlas projects such as the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org) (HuBMAP), the [Cellular Senescence Network](https://sennetconsortium.org) (SenNet), the [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org) (HTAN), the [Kidney Precision Medicine Network](https://www.kpmp.org/)(KPMP), and the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA).
 
You will participate in the full software development life cycle for the cell atlas projects that we are involved in such as the [HuBMAP Data Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org)  and [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io). Under the guidance of more senior developers on our team, you will implement client-side user interfaces and visualization tools using state of the art web development technologies. You will also be contributing to the development of Python or R software packages, server-side components, and data processing scripts.  You will be using automated testing, CI/CD, packaging, and documentation techniques to ensure high quality of our software.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The Gehlenborg Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!
