Based on the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, the Department of Biomedical Informatics is a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, students, engineers, and staff whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge in artificial intelligence, computational biology, and precision medicine. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, and great resources).

The HIDIVE Lab directed by Nils Gehlenborg is seeking a strong applicant for the position of Lab Coordinator to join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers and shape the future of biomedical research! The HIDIVE Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is funded to develop data visualization tools and user interfaces for genomics, bioimaging, spatial single-cell biology data. The lab also participates in many national and international consortia such as the NIH [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org) (HuBMAP), the NIH [Cellular Senescence Network](https://sennetconsortium.org/) (SenNet), the NIH [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org/) (HTAN), the NIH [Kidney Precision Medicine Network](https://www.kpmp.org/) (KPMP), the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA), and the NIH [4D Nucleome Consortium](https://www.4dnucleome.org/) (4DN).

As Lab Coordinator, you will help with administrative matters related to the operation and many projects of the lab and work closely with our team of 20-30 researchers, engineers, and designers. You will also work closely with other coordinators and administrators within the HIDIVE Lab, the Department, Harvard Medical School, and colleagues outside of the university.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The HIDIVE Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!
