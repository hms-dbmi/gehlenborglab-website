#### Project Overview
The [Gehlenborg Lab](http://gehlenborglab.org/) is working on multiple projects that focus on the visualization of genomics data. Such projects include, but are not limited to, visualization frameworks for genomics data, such as [Gosling](http://gosling-lang.org/) and [HiGlass](http://higlass.io/), and analytics tools based on the libraries, such as [Cistrome Explorer](http://cisvis.gehlenborglab.org/). We are seeking research assistants who can assist with these projects, such as collecting and processing data for visualization and implementing components for visualizations and web applications.

#### Qualifications
- Undergraduate or Masterâ€™s students in bio(medical) informatics, computational biology, computer science, data science, human-computer interaction, or related fields
- PhD students looking for a rotation opportunity
- Candidates who have experience in genomics data processing and analysis
- Candidates who have an interest in visualization
- Candidates who have experience with Python and/or JavaScript

#### Responsibilities
- Under guidance from mentors ([Sehi L'Yi](http://gehlenborglab.org/team/members/sehi-lyi/) and [Nils Gehlenborg](http://gehlenborglab.org/team/members/nils-gehlenborg/)), assist with multiple ongoing projects on genomics data visualization. This includes collecting and processing data for visualization, implementing components for visualizations and web applications, and surveying papers.
- Detailed tasks will be decided after the discussion with your mentors.
