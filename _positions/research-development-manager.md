Join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers and lead how we shape the future of biomedical research! 

The Gehlenborg Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is funded to develop data visualization tools and user interfaces for multiple national and international cell atlas projects such as the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org) (HuBMAP), the [Cellular Senescence Network](https://sennetconsortium.org) (SenNet), the [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org) (HTAN), the [Kidney Precision Medicine Network](https://www.kpmp.org/)(KPMP), the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA), and the [4D Nucleome Consortium](https://www.4dnucleome.org/) (4DN). Additionally, the lab is conducting research on novel biomedical data visualization methods for genomics and spatial single cell data with funding from institutions such as the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) and the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) (NHGRI). 
 
Our mission is to drive discovery through data visualization and we have developed multiple research software products (e.g., [HiGlass](http://higlass.io); [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io); [Gosling](http://gosling-lang.org); [HuBMAP Data Portal User Interface](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org); etc.) that are used by individual scientists, consortia, and companies all over the world. 

You will contribute to our mission by managing the development and design teams that are building, maintaining, and enhancing our software products in close collaboration with the principal investigator and researchers in the team. Your key responsibilities will include participation in strategic planning, oversight of day-to-day operations, and reporting to funders. Furthermore, you will work with the principal investigator and researchers on identifying opportunities to apply our software tools to new scientific problems, establishing and maintaining collaborations, disseminating our work through a wide range of channels including scientific publications and social media, and obtaining new funding.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The Gehlenborg Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!
