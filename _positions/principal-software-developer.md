Join our team of researchers, engineers, and designers to shape the future of biomedical research! 
The Gehlenborg Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is funded to develop data visualization tools and user interfaces for multiple national and international cell atlas projects such as the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org) (HuBMAP), the [Cellular Senescence Network](https://sennetconsortium.org) (SenNet), the [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org) (HTAN), the [Kidney Precision Medicine Network](https://www.kpmp.org/)(KPMP), and the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA). 
 
The ultimate goal of these efforts is to create maps of the human body at single-cell resolution with the help of cutting edge technologies that generate large and complex sequencing and imaging data sets. The maps will shape our understanding of processes like aging and usher in a new era of treatments for common human diseases. 
 
You will play an integral role in our software development efforts for the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), with the possibility to contribute to other cell atlas projects in the Gehlenborg Lab. With a deep understanding of the software development tasks needed to accomplish the goals of HuBMAP, you will architect and lead implementation of our software products, manage a team of developers, and appropriately allocate resources to accomplish those goals. You will have excellent communication skills to work closely with other remote HuBMAP partners at different national sites. In collaboration with the UI/UX team, you will digest high-level deliverables into actionable issues, plan sprints, and summarize the work completed. You will implement a rigorous testing and quality assurance process to maintain the high quality of our software products. You will be responsible for contributing to planning discussions, while keeping in mind larger project goals and low-level system constraints. You will lead technical meetings and contribute to quarterly reporting to funders. You will also play a lead role in hiring, onboarding, and training new software developers.

We value diversity, creativity, and initiative in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment. The Gehlenborg Lab has an international reputation for creating high impact data visualization tools and we are driven to solve the most challenging design and engineering problems in biomedical data science. We would love to have you on our team!
