In this project, we propose to build the Universal Discovery Interface (UDI) for the Biomedical Data Fabric Toolbox. We define a discovery interface as a data-centric, visual user interface designed to support exploration and discovery in biomedical data resources such as data repositories, data warehouse, knowledgebases, data portals, and others. We propose a discovery interface that can be applied to essentially any biomedical data resource and therefore refer to it as a universal discovery interface. The Universal Discovery Interface will:
  1) Provide an intuitive, exploratory approach for disease-agnostic discovery for a wide spectrum of biomedical data resources integrated into the Biomedical Data Fabric.
  2) Broaden access to biomedical data resources to reach larger audiences of data consumers.
  3) Increase effectiveness of exploratory interfaces for biomedical data resources.
  4) Make design, implementation, and maintenance of biomedical data resources more efficient.

The Universal Discovery Interface (UDI) will be a set of frontend and backend software components and machine learning (ML) models that can be integrated with any biomedical data resource. Once integrated, the UDI will provide support for exploration and discovery within and across biomedical data resources through natural language driven generation of interactive visualizations and dashboards.
