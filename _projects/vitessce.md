blurb: Visual Integration Tool for Exploration of Spatial Single-Cell Experiments
---

Vitessce is a demo of key concepts for a visual integration tool for exploration of (spatial) single-cell experiment data. This demo focusses on scalable, linked visualizations that support both spatial and non-spatial representation of cell-level and molecule-level data.
