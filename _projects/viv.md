blurb: Library for Multiscale Visualization of High-Resolution Multiplexed Tissue Data on the Web
---
Viv is a library for multiscale visualization of high-resolution, highly
multiplexed bioimaging data on the web. It directly renders OME-NGFF and OME-TIFF
formats. Avivator is a lightweight image viewer that showcases the capabilities of Viv.
The development of Viv and Avivator was supported with funding from the
National Institutes of Health and Harvard University.
