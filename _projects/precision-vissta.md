blurb: An interactive visualization interface to explore time-varied mobile health and survey data, enabling precise recommendations for lifestyle modifications to improve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) outcomes.
---

The overall goal of Precision VISSTA is to develop methods in the preprocessing, statistical and predictive analysis, and interactive visualization of big data from heterogeneous, time-varied mobile health and survey data. We develop exploratory visualization methods for personalized temporal trend and pattern discovery of these data for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim is to communicate and interpret computationally predicted disease outcomes, derived from applications of novel machine learning methods, to enable precise recommendations for lifestyle modifications and improve IBD outcomes.
