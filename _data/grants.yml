  summary: We propose to contribute a suite of cloud-based data visualization, exploration, and analysis tools that will make HuBMAP data FAIR and will enable broad re-use of this valuable resource within the community. We envision to support both batch and interactive analysis tools for power users, as well as task-speciﬁc UI-based analysis tools for end users without deep knowledge of computational approaches. Our goal is to also provide users with the ability to interact with analysis provenance in through visual interfaces. These will be based on the approaches that we developed for interaction with workﬂow-derived data provenance for reproducible biomedical research. Our visualization tools will be interactive and designed for both data exploration and communication. Based on our Vistories approach for reproducible visual analysis, we will create a bridge between these two distinct tasks. This will also make it possible to share observations and discoveries with remote collaborators. Both analysis and visualization tools will be embedded in a framework that will enable us to incorporate and deploy tools created by members of the HIVE, HuBMAP, and the broader community. Whenever possible, we will enhance existing tools and wrap them into a container-based, scalable, and cloud-agnostic deployment framework. To enable search and exploration of the enormous data space that will be generated by HuBMAP, we propose to implement a set of tools that enable systematic navigation and retrieval of omics and imaging data beyond text-based search. We will focus on the use of metadata and ontologies to accomplish this through interfaces similar to our SATORI system for ontology-guided visual exploration of biomedical data repositories. Finally, we will support collaboration within HuBMAP and the HIVE through visual analysis tools that enable monitoring of the overall project progress and data quality, including timelines for planned experiments, submitted data, and others.

  name: Visualization of (Epi)Genomic Data for Discovery of Disease-Associated Variants
  url: https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9128459&icde=33407223
  summary: This proposal combines an extensive mentored training program for the PI with a research project that aims to develop novel approaches for visualization and exploration that will accelerate the identification and validation of disease-associated variants in large and complex genomics and epigenomics data sets. An increasing number of such variants are discovered in studies that generate and analyze a wide range of molecular data types for thousands of patients or samples. This progress is enabled by the availability of computational analysis pipelines that employ sophisticated statistical methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Interpretation of analysis results by biological and clinical domain experts, however, is emerging as a major bottle- neck due to the amount and complexity of the pipeline outputs. To address this, we propose to develop inter- active visualization methods and a web-based infrastructure that will enable domain experts to identify disease-associated variants in large (epi)genomic data sets through visual exploration of computational predictions and the underlying data. This will have a significant impact on the rate at which predictions can be verified, interpreted and translated into clinically actionable finding. Our first priority is the design of methods and tools to visualize (epi) genomic data in a range of different contexts, for instance by grouping and representing features based on their function, chromatin state, transcriptional activity or genomic coordinates. We will also develop new non-linear genome representations to compare structural variants across genomes, complementing the functionality of the highly successful genome browsers. We then investigate how information external to the primary data - for instance from other studies, drug target or biomarker databases - can be applied to guide investigators through the data set. Finally, we implement a web-based exploration system for biological and clinical domain an expert that combines our interactive visualizations with large-scale public (epi) genomic data sets. The methods and tools developed under this proposal will be generally applicable and driving biological examples are chosen from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE and modENCODE).

  summary: The goals of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) are to collect, store, curate, display, and analyze data generated in the 4DN Network. We have assembled a team of investigators with a strong track record in analysis of chromatin interaction data, image processing and three-dimensional data visualization, integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data, data portal development, large-scale computing, and development of secure and flexible cloud technologies. In Aim 1, we will develop efficient submission pipelines for data and metadata from 4DN data production groups. We will define data/metadata requirements and quality metrics in conjunction with the production groups and ensure that high-quality, well- annotated data become available to the wider scientific community in a timely manner. In Aim 2, we will develop a user-friendly data portal for the broad scientific community. This portal will provide an easy-to-navigate interface for accessing raw and intermediate data ¿les, allow for programmatic access via APIs, and will incorporate novel analysis and visualization tools developed by DCIC as well as other Network members. For computing and storage scalability and cost-effectiveness, significant efforts will be devoted to development and deployment of cloud-based technology. We will conduct tutorials and workshops to facilitate the use of 4DN data and tools by external investigators. In Aim 3, we will coordinate and assist in conducting integrative analysis of the multiple data types. These efforts will examine key questions in higher-order chromatin organization using both sequence and image data, and the tools and algorithms developed here will be incorporated into the data portal for use by other investigators. These three aims will ensure that the data generated in 4DN will have maximal impact for the scientific community.

  name: Visual Analysis of Genomic and Clinical Data from Large Patient Cohorts
  url: https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9070659&icde=33408453
  summary: Comprehensive large cohort studies that collect a wide variety of genomic, epigenomic and clinical data are increasingly commonplace in the life sciences. While large sample sizes are still limited to well-funded consortia, the continuous cost decrease of data acquisition will allow individual labs to create larger datasets with fewer resources and will make genomic data analysis for the diagnosis of patients feasible. While this opens unprecedented possibilities for understanding the molecular processes underlying many diseases, it also poses challenges, especially with respect to data analysis and data management. There is a high demand for better analysis and visualization methods to keep pace with the increasing amount of data. At the same time, these data acquisition methods will also revolutionize the discovery and diagnosis of rare diseases. The integration of genomics data with extensive patient records and large patient cohorts promises diagnosis and potentially treatment to those with rare or undiagnosed diseases. In this project we will create novel methods and provide unique software tools that will meet this significant demand. Our methods are a departure from existing visualization approaches that are typically focused on visualizing particular molecular and clinical data types while neglecting the context of a patient cohort. Our proposed approach is distinguished from previous work by taking into account these complex relationships between patients in a cohort. In addition, our approach is the first to integrate genomic data at all scales while supporting the interactive analysis, creation and refinement of patient subsets. We will address this challenge by (1) developing visualization techniques, deeply integrated with algorithmic support, to identify and characterize disease subtypes. Specifically, we will develop methods that will allow clinical and experimental investigators to go beyond analyzing simple relationships, creating the potential to reveal the less obvious and indirect molecular causes of many diseases. (2) We will create novel visualizations that employ algorithms to select and display important genomic characteristics and the patient's clinical history to study and diagnose rare diseases. (3) We will create a framework to support the development of web-based visual exploration tools, which we will use to create the visualizations for subtype and rare disease analysis. Additionally, we will also make this framework available for the community to use for other tools. This will allow future projects to produce visual analysis methods that scale to the challenges of big data with less engineering overhead. This project will be a close collaboration between a team of computational (epi) genomics and cancer researchers in the laboratory of the Principal Investigator Peter Park at the Harvard Medical School and data visualization experts in the laboratory of the Co-Investigator Hanspeter Pfister at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. This team possesses the unique combination of expertise that is required to successfully address the challenges that motivate this application.
