David Kouřil is a postdoctoral research fellow in Nils Gehlenborg’s HIDIVE lab. Originally from the Czech Republic, David received his doctoral degree from TU Wien in Vienna, Austria, in 2021. His doctoral research focused on visualizing mesoscopic biological models with the aim of science communication and outreach to non-expert audiences. David’s broader research interests lie in designing novel visualization and interaction methods that support exploring and understanding environments depicted by various biomedical data. At HIDIVE, David's work revolves around three-dimensional genomic data, such as predictions of chromatin folding in cell nucleus.
