Devin Lange, PhD, is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and a member of the HIDIVE lab.

Devin Lange received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Utah where he developed visualization tools for live-cell imaging analysis and data forensics to investigate possible data falsification.

The goal of Devin's research is to improve the ways that people can use visualizations to interact with their data, especially biomedical data, which is often large-scale and multimodal. Devin's research focuses on how visualization interfaces can help people parse this large amount of data and synthesize the different modalities together to form a better understanding of the underlying phenomenon and ultimately get more value from their data.
