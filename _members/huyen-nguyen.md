Huyen N. Nguyen, PhD, is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the HIDIVE Lab, led by Nils Gehlenborg, at the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.

Huyen received her PhD in Computer Science from Texas Tech University, where she cultivated an interest in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. The primary goal of her research centers on exploring and communicating insights from temporal patterns through interactive visual interfaces. This vision was actualized with the development and rise in popularity of [WordStream](https://huyen-nguyen.github.io/WordStream/)—a library and an end-to-end platform dedicated for visualizing the evolution of topics over time. Her doctoral studies focused on interactive time-series visualizations, spanning both quantitative and qualitative data. At HIDIVE, Dr. Nguyen’s work involves developing visualization systems to efficiently explore and interact with genomics and nucleomics data.
