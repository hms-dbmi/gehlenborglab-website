Max is an HMS Curriculum Fellow working with Nils Gehlenborg at DBMI. He is working on the organization and reshaping of the Master of Biomedical Informatics program. Max's research focuses on studying evolutionary and structural signatures of protein-coding function in mammals. He is particularly interested in identifying gene regions with unusually high mutation rates and understanding the mechanisms driving mutation and selection rates. Prior to coming to HMS, Max completed his PhD in Computational and Systems biology at MIT.
