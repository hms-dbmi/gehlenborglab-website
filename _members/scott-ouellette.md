Scott's contributions in the lab exist mainly in the realm of back-end web development within the Django framework. He has enough knowledge at all levels of the software development stack to be comfortable taking on tasks wherever needed. He started his early web development days on the front-end, but a love of Python, and introductions to things like Django and Flask quickly changed his mind.
