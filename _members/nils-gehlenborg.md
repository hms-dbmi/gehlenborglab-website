Nils Gehlenborg, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, Director of the [Master in Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/mbi) program, and Director of the [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/nlm-biomedical-informatics-data-science-fellowship) (BIRT) program.

Nils received his PhD from the University of Cambridge and was a predoctoral fellow at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in the Functional Genomics Group of Alvis Brazma. Dr Gehlenborg completed his postdoctoral training as a Research Associate in the lab of Peter J Park at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. 
 
The goal of Nils' research is to improve human health by developing visual interfaces and computational techniques that enable scientists and clinicians to efficiently interact with biomedical data. Tight integration of algorithmic approaches from biomedical informatics with advanced data visualization techniques is central to his efforts, as is close collaboration with clinicians and experimentalists. Currently, Nils is researching and developing novel tools to visualize 3D genome conformation data as well as heterogeneous data from large-scale cancer genomics studies. These efforts integrate visual and computational approaches to support sense-making in biology and to support reproducible, collaborative research. Nils is also a Co-Investigator for the 4D Nucleome Network Data Coordination and Integration Center hosted at Harvard Medical School. 
 
Nils is a co-founder, former general chair, and current steering committee chair of BioVis, the Symposium on Biological Data Visualization, and co-founder of VIZBI, the annual workshop on Visualizing Biological Data. Currently, he co-chairs the Policy Working Group for the 4D Nucleome Network, an NIH Common Fund project. Nils has served on the program committees of several international bioinformatics and data visualization conferences and held multiple editorial roles, including his current role as associate editor of BMC Bioinformatics. He has also contributed to the “Points of View” data visualization column in Nature Methods.
