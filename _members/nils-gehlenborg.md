Nils Gehlenborg, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Starting July 1st, he will also serve as the Director of the Biomedical Informatics Master’s Programs.

Dr Gehlenborg received his PhD from the University of Cambridge and was a predoctoral fellow at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in the Functional Genomics Group of Alvis Brazma. Dr Gehlenborg completed his postdoctoral training as a Research Associate in the lab of Peter J Park at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. 
 
The goal of Dr Gehlenborg’s research is to improve human health by developing visual interfaces and computational techniques that enable scientists and clinicians to efficiently interact with biomedical data. Tight integration of algorithmic approaches from biomedical informatics with advanced data visualization techniques is central to his efforts, as is close collaboration with clinicians and experimentalists. Currently, Dr Gehlenborg is researching and developing novel tools to visualize 3D genome conformation data as well as heterogeneous data from large-scale cancer genomics studies. These efforts integrate visual and computational approaches to support sense-making in biology and to support reproducible, collaborative research. Dr Gehlenborg is also a Co-Investigator for the 4D Nucleome Network Data Coordination and Integration Center hosted at Harvard Medical School. 
 
Dr Gehlenborg is a co-founder, former general chair, and current steering committee chair of BioVis, the Symposium on Biological Data Visualization, and co-founder of VIZBI, the annual workshop on Visualizing Biological Data. Currently, he co-chairs the Policy Working Group for the 4D Nucleome Network, an NIH Common Fund project. Dr Gehlenborg  has served on the program committees of several international bioinformatics and data visualization conferences and held multiple editorial roles, including his current role as associate editor of BMC Bioinformatics. Dr Gehlenborg has also contributed to the “Points of View” data visualization column in Nature Methods.
