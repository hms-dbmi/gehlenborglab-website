Eunice Lee is a research intern in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, as part of the Summer Institute in Biomedical Informatics (SIBMI). She is a rising senior at Duke University pursuing a major in statistical science (data science concentration) and minors in chemistry and computational biology & bioinformatics.

The goal of Eunice's research is to leverage data visualization and statistical tools in computational multiomics for precision oncology. At HIDIVE Lab, she is developing an extension on Vitessce that directly extracts and analyzes cell-to-cell interaction profiles from 3D volumetric images. To enable a seamless and scalable exploration of complex cellular relationships on web-based platforms, she is generating motif-searchable cell interaction graphs and further exploring Extending Reality (XR) capabilities of such visualizations.
