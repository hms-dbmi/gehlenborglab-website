Siyoung is an intern in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School as a part of the Summer Institute in Biomedical Informatics (SIBMI).

She is a fifth-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology (6-7) and minoring in Creative Writing (21W) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Her website is currently down because it hasn't been updated in years and is quite frankly embarrassing.

The goal of Siyoung's research is to curate a large-scale dataset of genomics visualizations and textual descriptions and apply visual language models for collection, annotation, and evaluation.
