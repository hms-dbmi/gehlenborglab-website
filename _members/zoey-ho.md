Zoey is a master’s student studying Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, where she is working in the Gehlenborg lab to build a data-driven personalized visualization that can speed up and improve physicians’ decision-making process and help clinical researchers to better understand the EHR data of a patient. She is interested in combining bioinformatics, data visualization, and computer science to build intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Before joining the lab, she worked in Dr. Yun Li’s lab on the improvement of imputation quality and detection of rare variant associations in admixed African and Hispanic/Latino populations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
