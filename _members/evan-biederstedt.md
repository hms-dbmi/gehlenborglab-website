Evan is a computational biologist with a background both in cancer genomics and in single-cell genomics with the [Peter Kharchenko Lab](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/). He is now spearheading the development of the Cell Annotation Platform (CAP), infrastructure designed to improve our ability to interpret cellular state by facilitating the accumulation, sharing and analysis of relevant metadata and molecular signatures. He is also part of the [Alexandra-Chloé Villani Lab](https://villani.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute.
