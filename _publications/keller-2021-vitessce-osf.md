Vitessce is an open-source interactive visualization framework for exploration of multi-modal and spatially-resolved single-cell data, with a modular architecture compatible with transcriptomic, proteomic, genome-mapped, and imaging data types. Its modular, coordinated multiple view implementation facilitates a wide range of visualization tasks to support all common single-cell assays. Vitessce is a client-side web application designed to be integrated with computational analysis tools and data resources and does not require specialized server infrastructure. The software is available at http://vitessce.io.
