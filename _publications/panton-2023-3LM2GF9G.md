### Background
The discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery with patients is a defining component of informed consent. As shared-decision making has become central to surgeon-patient communication, risk calculators have emerged as a tool to aid communication and decision-making. To optimize informed consent, it is necessary to understand how surgeons assess and communicate risk, and the role of risk calculators in this process.

### Methods
We conducted interviews with 13 surgeons from two institutions to understand how surgeons assess risk, the role of risk calculators in decision-making, and how surgeons approach risk communication during informed consent. We performed a qualitative analysis of interviews based on SRQR guidelines.

### Results
Our analysis yielded insights regarding (a) the landscape and approach to obtaining surgical consent; (b) detailed perceptions regarding the value and design of assessing and communicating risk; and (c) practical considerations regarding the future of personalized risk communication in decision-making. Above all, we found that non-clinical factors such as health and risk literacy are changing how surgeons assess and communicate risk, which diverges from traditional risk calculators.

### Conclusion
Principally, we found that surgeons incorporate a range of clinical and non-clinical factors to risk stratify patients and determine how to optimally frame and discuss risk with individual patients. We observed that surgeons’ perception of risk communication, and the importance of eliciting patient preferences to direct shared-decision making, did not consistently align with patient priorities. This study underscored criticisms of risk calculators and novel decision-aids – which must be addressed prior to greater adoption.
