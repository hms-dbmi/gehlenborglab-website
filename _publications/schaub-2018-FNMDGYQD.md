Although the MYC oncogene has been implicated in cancer, a systematic
assessment of alterations of MYC, related transcription factors, and
co-regulatory proteins, forming the proximal MYC network (PMN), across human
cancers is lacking. Using computational approaches, we define genomic and
proteomic features associated with MYC and the PMN across the 33 cancers of The
Cancer Genome Atlas. Pan-cancer, 28% of all samples had at least one of the MYC
paralogs amplified. In contrast, the MYC antagonists MGA and MNT were the most
frequently mutated or deleted members, proposing a role as tumor suppressors.
MYC alterations were mutually exclusive with PIK3CA, PTEN, APC, or BRAF
alterations, suggesting that MYC is a distinct oncogenic driver. Expression
analysis revealed MYC-associated pathways in tumor subtypes, such as immune
response and growth factor signaling; chromatin, translation, and DNA
replication/repair were conserved pan-cancer. This analysis reveals insights
into MYC biology and is a reference for biomarkers and therapeutics for cancers
with alterations of MYC or the PMN.
