In many science domains data analysis has replaced data acquisition,
generation, and storage as the main challenge. This challenge stems not only
from volume but also from complexity and heterogeneity of the data. Molecular
biology is a prime example for this trend. We identified six key aspects that a
visual analysis platform for biological data should support. We address these
aspects with the development of Caleydo Web. In this poster we describe its
architecture and give an example of how it can be used to create StratomeX.js,
a sophisticated visualization technique for cancer subtype characterization.
