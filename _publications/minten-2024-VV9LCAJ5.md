Genomic sequencing is poised to expand newborn screening for treatable
childhood-onset disorders. Over 30 international research studies and companies
are exploring its use, collectively aiming to screen more than 500,000 infants.
A key challenge is determining which genes to include in screening. Among 27
newborn sequencing programs, the number of genes analyzed ranged from 134 to
4,299, with only 74 genes included by over 80% of programs. To understand this
variability, we assembled a dataset with 25 characteristics of 4,389 genes
included in any program and used a multivariate regression analysis to identify
characteristics associated with inclusion across programs. These
characteristics included presence on the US Recommended Uniform Screening
panel, evidence regarding the natural history of disease, and efficacy of
treatment. We then used a machine learning model to generate a ranked list of
genes, offering a data-driven approach to the future prioritization of
disorders for public health newborn screening efforts.
