We present an integromic analysis of gene alterations that modulate
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-Smad-mediated signaling in 9,125 tumor
samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Focusing on
genes that encode mediators and regulators of TGF-β signaling, we found at
least one genomic alteration (mutation, homozygous deletion, or amplification)
in 39% of samples, with highest frequencies in gastrointestinal cancers. We
identified mutation hotspots in genes that encode TGF-β ligands (BMP5),
receptors (TGFBR2, AVCR2A, and BMPR2), and Smads (SMAD2 and SMAD4). Alterations
in the TGF-β superfamily correlated positively with expression of
metastasis-associated genes and with decreased survival. Correlation analyses
showed the contributions of mutation, amplification, deletion, DNA methylation,
and miRNA expression to transcriptional activity of TGF-β signaling in each
cancer type. This study provides a broad molecular perspective relevant for
future functional and therapeutic studies of the diverse cancer pathways
mediated by the TGF-β superfamily.
