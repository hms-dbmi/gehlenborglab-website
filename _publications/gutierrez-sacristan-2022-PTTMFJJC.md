## Importance

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increase in mental health
diagnoses among adolescents, though the extent of the increase, particularly
for severe cases requiring hospitalization, has not been well characterized.
Large-scale federated informatics approaches provide the ability to efficiently
and securely query health care data sets to assess and monitor hospitalization
patterns for mental health conditions among adolescents.

## Objective

To estimate changes in the proportion of hospitalizations associated with
mental health conditions among adolescents following onset of the COVID-19
pandemic.


## Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, multisite cohort study of adolescents 11 to 17 years of age
who were hospitalized with at least 1 mental health condition diagnosis between
February 1, 2019, and April 30, 2021, used patient-level data from electronic
health records of 8 children’s hospitals in the US and France.


## Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in the monthly proportion of mental health condition–associated
hospitalizations between the prepandemic (February 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020)
and pandemic (April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021) periods using interrupted time
series analysis.


## Results

There were 9696 adolescents hospitalized with a mental health condition during
the prepandemic period (5966 [61.5%] female) and 11 101 during the pandemic
period (7603 [68.5%] female). The mean (SD) age in the prepandemic cohort was
14.6 (1.9) years and in the pandemic cohort, 14.7 (1.8) years. The most
prevalent diagnoses during the pandemic were anxiety (6066 [57.4%]), depression
(5065 [48.0%]), and suicidality or self-injury (4673 [44.2%]). There was an
increase in the proportions of monthly hospitalizations during the pandemic for
anxiety (0.55%; 95% CI, 0.26%-0.84%), depression (0.50%; 95% CI, 0.19%-0.79%),
and suicidality or self-injury (0.38%; 95% CI, 0.08%-0.68%). There was an
estimated 0.60% increase (95% CI, 0.31%-0.89%) overall in the monthly
proportion of mental health–associated hospitalizations following onset of the
pandemic compared with the prepandemic period.


## Conclusions and Relevance
In this cohort study, onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with
increased hospitalizations with mental health diagnoses among adolescents.
These findings support the need for greater resources within children’s
hospitals to care for adolescents with mental health conditions during the
pandemic and beyond.
