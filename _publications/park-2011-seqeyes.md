We have created a prototype tool called Seqeyes to explore and interpret
predicted structural variations to help guide experimental validations. Users
can sort, filter, and aggregate samples based on clinical attributes. Our tool
provides both linear and circular representations. Multiple molecular data
types including copy number, gene expression, and methylation microarrays for
each sample are integrated as additional genomic tracks. We leverage advanced
open-source indexes available to greatly enhance the speed and amount of data
available to visualize. Seqeyes is a novel multi-scale visualization that can
interactively navigate dozens of genomes down to individual sequencing reads
within a web browser.
