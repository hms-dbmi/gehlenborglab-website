  Screenshot YAC discovery interface, combining a chat panel and a linked visualization dashboard for interactive data
  exploration. On the left, the chat interface displays user queries and agent responses, with widgets that let users
  adjust visualizations and filters. On the right, the dashboard contains multiple generated charts that update
  dynamically based on filters and selections. The chat interface includes visualization adjustment widgets,
  agent-generated filters, and user-controlled filters. The dashboard provides bar charts, scatterplots, and cumulative
  distribution plots, all linked so that selections in one view update the others. A status bar shows record counts for
  entities, a filter bar displays currently active filters, and a download button allows exporting the selected data.

We explore the potential for combining generative AI with grammar-based visualizations for biomedical data discovery. In our prototype, we use a multi-agent system to generate visualization specifications and apply filters. These visualizations are linked together, resulting in an interactive dashboard that is progressively constructed. Our system leverages the strengths of natural language while maintaining the utility of traditional user interfaces. Furthermore, we utilize generated interactive widgets enabling user adjustment. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of this system for biomedical data discovery with a case study.
