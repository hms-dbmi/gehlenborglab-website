Microarray data often contain missing values due to experimental and technical
limitations, which can hinder accurate analysis. CLIMP (Cluster-based
Imputation) uses hierarchical clustering to estimate missing values based on
gene expression similarity. Compared to existing techniques like KNNimpute and
BPCA, CLIMP offers a structured approach to improving data integrity while
maintaining comparable accuracy to KNN-based methods.
