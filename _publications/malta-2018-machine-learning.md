Cancer progression involves the gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and
acquisition of progenitor and stem-cell-like features. Here, we provide novel
stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We
used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning
algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from
non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using
OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms
associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor
microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with
immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the
dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic
tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed
patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed
for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed
at tumor differentiation.
