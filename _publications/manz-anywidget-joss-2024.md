The anywidget project provides a specification and toolset for creating
portable web-based widgets for computational notebooks. It defines a standard
for front-end widget code using ECMAScript modules and offers tools for
authoring, distributing, and executing these modules across Jupyter-compatible
platforms (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab, VS Code). The project has spurred
the creation of many interactive visualization libraries and has been
integrated into existing ones. The standard has been embraced by other
computational notebooks, web frameworks, and publishing platforms, extending
the reach of interactive widgets beyond the Jupyter ecosystem.
