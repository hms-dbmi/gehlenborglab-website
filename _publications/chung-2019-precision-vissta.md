A Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) model for contributing mobile health (mHealth)
data enables real-world data collection as patients go about their daily
activities. To date, most mHealth research studies provision a specific
wearable device (i.e., Fitbit) and have a constrained study period during which
data is collected. A BYOD mHealth model allows for capturing data from
patients’ routine lives and has efficiencies at scale, allowing researchers to
better understand patient trajectories in a real-world deployment of devices.
There are growing examples of BYOD data contribution for the purposes of
research including the PCORnet Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Partners
(formerly Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America) patient-powered research
network, and NIH’s All of Us Research Program, where participants can currently
contribute their Fitbit data. IBD Partners allows for a wide range of wearable
devices and apps to be connected to our research platform. This facilitates
mHealth data contribution for those who participate in our longitudinal
Internet cohort study. These mHealth contributors can connect different devices
over time and can view their data trends in the IBD Partners patient portal.
Participants also contribute self-reported survey data on health outcomes, such
as disease activity, as well as on patient- reported outcomes such as
depression and anxiety. While BYOD has many benefits, there are also challenges
due to the diversity of both devices/apps and usage patterns that come with
real-world data generation. As this BYOD data contribution model is still an
emerging one, there is little known about how many patients will choose to
contribute their mHealth data, and how those patients may differ from those who
do not. We examine which brands are represented across mHealth contributors
within the cohort, the patterns for device wear-time (usage) among these
participants, and blocks of missingness where devices/apps were not used. In
this oral abstract, we present an overview of the characteristics of a BYOD
mHealth study, Precision VISSTA, which is an NIH-funded study that seeks to
develop preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization methods for
mHealth data to generate precision health recommendations for patients with
IBDs as the initial use case.
