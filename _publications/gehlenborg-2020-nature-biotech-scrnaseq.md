Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has undergone major technological advances in recent years, enabling the conception of various organism-level cell atlassing projects. With increasing numbers of datasets being deposited in public archives, there is a need to address the challenges of enabling the reproducibility of such data sets. Here, we describe guidelines for a minimum set of metadata to sufficiently describe scRNA-Seq experiments, ensuring reproducibility of data analyses.
