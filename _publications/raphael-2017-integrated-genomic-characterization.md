We performed integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling of 150
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens, including samples with
characteristic low neoplastic cellularity. Deep whole-exome sequencing revealed
recurrent somatic mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, RNF43, ARID1A,
TGFÎ²R2, GNAS, RREB1, and PBRM1. KRAS wild-type tumors harbored alterations in
other oncogenic drivers, including GNAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, and additional RAS
pathway genes. A subset of tumors harbored multiple KRAS mutations, with some
showing evidence of biallelic mutations. Protein profiling identified a
favorable prognosis subset with low epithelial-mesenchymal transition and high
MTOR pathway scores. Associations of non-coding RNAs with tumor-specific mRNA
subtypes were also identified. Our integrated multi-platform analysis reveals a
complex molecular landscape of PDAC and provides a roadmap for precision
medicine.
