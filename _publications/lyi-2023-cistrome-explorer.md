The regulation of genes by cis-regulatory elements is complex and differs between cell types. Visual analysis of large collections of chromatin profiles across diverse cell types, integrated with computational methods, can reveal meaningful biological insights.
We developed Cistrome Explorer, a web-based interactive visual analytics tool for exploring thousands of chromatin profiles in diverse cell types. Integrated with the Cistrome Data Browser database which contains thousands of ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq samples, Cistrome Explorer enables the discovery of patterns of cis-regulatory elements across cell types and the identification of transcription factor binding underlying these patterns.
Cistrome Explorer and its source code are available at http://cisvis.gehlenborglab.org/ and released under the MIT License. Documentation can be accessed via http://cisvis.gehlenborglab.org/docs/.
