The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the “4D
Nucleome”) is closely linked to genome function. Here, we integrate a wide
variety of genomic data generated by the 4D Nucleome Project to provide a
detailed view of human 3D genome organization in widely used embryonic stem
cells (H1-hESCs) and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We provide extensive
benchmarking of 3D genome mapping assays and integrate these diverse datasets
to annotate spatial genomic features across scales. The data reveal a rich
complexity of chromatin domains and their sub-nuclear positions, and over one
hundred thousand structural loops and promoter-enhancer interactions. We
developed 3D models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation
in genome structure, establishing connections between chromosome folding,
nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription, and DNA
replication. We demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome
folding from DNA sequence, uncovering potential effects of genetic variants on
genome structure and function. Together, this comprehensive analysis
contributes insights into human genome organization and enhances our
understanding of connections between the regulation of genome function and 3D
genome organization in general.
