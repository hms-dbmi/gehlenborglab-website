In the United States, patients can access their electronic health record (EHR) data through patient portals. However, current patient portals are mainly focused on a single provider, with very limited data sharing capabilities and put low emphasis on independent sensemaking of the EHR data. This makes it very challenging for patients to switch between different portals and aggregate the data to obtain a complete picture of their medical history and to make sense of it. Owing to this fragmentation, patients are exposed to numerous inconveniences such as medical errors, repeated tests, and limited self-advocacy. To overcome the limitations of EHR patient portals, we designed and developed Discovery—a web-based application that aggregates EHR data from multiple providers and present them to the patient for efficient exploration and sensemaking. To learn how well Discovery meets the patients’ sensemaking needs and what features should such applications include, we conducted an evaluation study.
