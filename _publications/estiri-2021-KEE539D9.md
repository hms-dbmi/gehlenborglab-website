  Diagram of a study cohort including all MGB patients tested for COVID-19. It outlines pre-test diagnoses, PCR testing
  during the acute phase, and classification into COVID-positive or COVID-negative groups. Novel post-test diagnoses are
  identified beyond the acute phase.

For some SARS-CoV-2 survivors, recovery from the acute phase of the infection
has been grueling with lingering effects. Many of the symptoms characterized as
the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are
similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of
PASC phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the
healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age-
and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection.

In this retrospective electronic health record (EHR) cohort study, we applied a
computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to
identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We
evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3–6 and
6–9 months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal
diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston
Metropolitan Area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were
performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included
over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and
were not hospitalized.

We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows
that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified
phenotypes were newly recorded in patients’ medical records 2 months or longer
after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the
test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and
dysgeusia (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.94–3.46]), alopecia (OR 3.09, 95% CI
[2.53–3.76]), chest pain (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.09–1.48]), chronic fatigue
syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22–2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI
[1.22–1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28–2.16]), and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22–1.64]) is one of the most significant
indicators of a past COVID-19 infection. Additionally, more new phenotypes were
found with increased confidence among the cohorts who were younger than 65.

The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID-19 symptoms and
suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and
neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of
COVID-19 than those without the infection. Additionally, more than 63% of PASC
phenotypes were observed in patients under 65 years of age, pointing out the
importance of vaccination to minimize the risk of debilitating post-acute
sequelae of COVID-19 among younger adults.
