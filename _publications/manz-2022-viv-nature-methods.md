Advances in highly multiplexed imaging have enabled the comprehensive profiling
of complex tissues in healthy and diseased states, facilitating the study of
fundamental biology and human disease at spatially-resolved, subcellular resolution.
While the rapid innovation of biological imaging poses significant scientific value,
the proliferation of technologies without unification of interoperable standards have created 
challenges limiting analysis and sharing of results.

We introduce [Viv](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv) – an open-source bioimaging
visualization library which supports OME-TIFF and OME-NGFF directly on the web.
Viv addresses a critical limitation of most web-based bioimaging viewers by
removing a dependency on server-side rendering, offering a flexible toolkit
for browsing multi-terabyte datasets on both mobile and desktop devices
– without software installation.
