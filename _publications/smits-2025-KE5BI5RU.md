  A visual overview of the ten rules for making biomedical data resources accessible. Three boxes labeled with "assess,"
  "construct," and "consider" are underneath each other. Each contains smaller boxes that represent individual rules, as
  described in the main text. The six rules in the "construct" box are marked with one of the letters in the POUR
  acronym.
