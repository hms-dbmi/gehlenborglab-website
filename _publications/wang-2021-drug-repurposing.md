Faced with skyrocketing costs for developing new drugs from scratch,
repurposing existing drugs for new uses is an enticing alternative that
considerably reduces safety risks and development costs. However, successful
drug repurposing has been mainly based on serendipitous discoveries. Here, we
present a tool that combines a graph transformer network with interactive
visual explanations to assist scientists in generating, exploring, and
understanding drug repurposing predictions. Leveraging semantic attention in
our graph transformer network, our tool introduces a novel way to visualize
meta path explanations that provide biomedical context for interpretation. Our
results show that the tool generates accurate drug predictions and provides
interpretable predictions.
