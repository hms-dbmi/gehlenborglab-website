DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and
therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide
a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with
accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes,
including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic
silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in âˆ¼20% of samples.
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in
many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian
cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers.
Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences
of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier
developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that
phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in
many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer
progression and guide therapy.
