Venn and Euler diagrams are a popular yet inadequate solution for quantitative visualization of set intersections. A scalable alternative to Venn and Euler diagrams for visualizing intersecting sets and their properties is needed. We developed UpSetR, an open source R package that employs a scalable matrix-based visualization to show intersections of sets, their size, and other properties. UpSetR is available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=UpSetR and released under the MIT License. A Shiny app is available at https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr.
