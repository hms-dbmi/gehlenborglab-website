The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code (U09.9) for post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) was introduced in October of 2021. As researchers seek to leverage this billing code for research purposes in large scale real-world studies of PASC, it is of utmost importance to understand the functional use of the code by healthcare providers and the clinical characteristics of patients who have been assigned this code. To this end, we operationalized clinical case definitions of PASC using World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidelines. We then chart reviewed 300 patients with COVID-19 from three participating healthcare systems of the 4CE Consortium who were assigned the U09.9 code. Chart review results showed the average positive predictive value (PPV) of the U09.9 code ranged from 40.2% to 65.4% depending on which definition of PASC was used in the evaluation. The PPV of the U09.9 code also fluctuated significantly between calendar time periods. We demonstrated the potential utility of textual data extracted from natural language processing techniques to more comprehensively capture symptoms associated with PASC from electronic health records data. Finally, we investigated the utilization of long COVID clinics in the cohort of patients. We observed that only an average of 24.0% of patients with the U09.9 code visited a long COVID clinic. Among patients who met the WHO PASC definition, only an average of 35.6% visited a long COVID clinic.
