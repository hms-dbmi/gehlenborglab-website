We describe the landscape of somatic genomic alterations of 66 chromophobe
renal cell carcinomas (ChRCCs) on the basis of multidimensional and
comprehensive characterization, including mtDNA and whole-genome sequencing.
The result is consistent that ChRCC originates from the distal nephron compared
with other kidney cancers with more proximal origins. Combined mtDNA and gene
expression analysis implicates changes in mitochondrial function as a component
of the disease biology, while suggesting alternative roles for mtDNA mutations
in cancers relying on oxidative phosphorylation. Genomic rearrangements lead to
recurrent structural breakpoints within TERT promoter region, which correlates
with highly elevated TERT expression and manifestation of kataegis,
representing a mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancer distinct from
previously observed amplifications and point mutations.
