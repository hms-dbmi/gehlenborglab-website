We analyzed molecular data on 2,579 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
of four gynecological types plus breast. Our aims were to identify shared and
unique molecular features, clinically significant subtypes, and potential
therapeutic targets. We found 61 somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and 46
significantly mutated genes (SMGs). Eleven SCNAs and 11 SMGs had not been
identified in previous TCGA studies of the individual tumor types. We found
functionally significant estrogen receptor-regulated long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) and gene/lncRNA interaction networks. Pathway analysis identified
subtypes with high leukocyte infiltration, raising potential implications for
immunotherapy. Using 16 key molecular features, we identified five prognostic
subtypes and developed a decision tree that classified patients into the
subtypes based on just six features that are assessable in clinical
laboratories.
