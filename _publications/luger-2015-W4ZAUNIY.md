A major challenge of data-intensive biomedical research is the collection and
representation of provenance information to ensure reproducibility of the
studies. The Refinery Platform (http://www.refinery-platform.org) is an
integrated data management, analysis, and visualization system designed to
support reproducible biomedical research. Refinery stores each data set as a
directed acyclic experiment graph that associates every file in the data set
with meta data annotations as well as the analyses and input files that were
used to create it. In order to communicate and reproduce multi-step analyses on
data sets that contain data for hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able
to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of detail. Most existing
approaches for provenance visualization are based on node-link diagrams,
however, they usually do not scale well to due to the limitations of the this
visualization approach.  Our proposed visualization technique dynamically
reduces the complexity of subgraphs through hierarchical aggregation and
application of a degree-of-interest (DOI) function to each node. Triggered by
user interactions such as filtering for a subset of analyses or highlighting of
a path in the graph, subgraphs are dynamically aggregated into a glyph
representation. We further reduce the complexity of the provenance graph
visualization by layering identical or similar sequences of parallel analysis
steps into an aggregate sequence. We have implemented our approach in Refinery
and our initial results are very promising. Future work will focus on the
fine-tuning of the DOI function and comphrehensive user testing.
