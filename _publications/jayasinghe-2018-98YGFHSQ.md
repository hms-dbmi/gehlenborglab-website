For the past decade, cancer genomic studies have focused on mutations leading
to splice-site disruption, overlooking those having splice-creating potential.
Here, we applied a bioinformatic tool, MiSplice, for the large-scale discovery
of splice-site-creating mutations (SCMs) across 8,656 TCGA tumors. We report
1,964 originally mis-annotated mutations having clear evidence of creating
alternative splice junctions. TP53 and GATA3 have 26 and 18 SCMs, respectively,
and ATRX has 5 from lower-grade gliomas. Mutations in 11 genes, including
PARP1, BRCA1, and BAP1, were experimentally validated for splice-site-creating
function. Notably, we found that neoantigens induced by SCMs are likely several
folds more immunogenic compared to missense mutations, exemplified by the
recurrent GATA3 SCM. Further, high expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was observed in
tumors with SCMs, suggesting candidates for immune blockade therapy. Our work
highlights the importance of integrating DNA and RNA data for understanding the
functional and the clinical implications of mutations in human diseases.
