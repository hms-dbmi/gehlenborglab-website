There is a growing demand for the adoption of user-centric design processes for the development of computational biology software as usability becomes a major concern. Our team develops interfaces for a human biomolecular data portal with user-centered design, so we present a case study of the design process of a molecular and cellular query to emphasize the importance of user-centric design and reveal the complications that arise in a complex software development environment. The study follows the design process from user requirement gathering to the prototyping of a minimum viable product.
