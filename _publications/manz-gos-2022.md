Gos is a declarative library for Python designed to create interactive multi-scale visualizations of genomics and epigenomics data. It provides a consistent and simple API to author custom visualizations based on the Gosling visualization grammar. Gos abstracts away technical complexities involved with configuring web-based genome browsers and integrates seamlessly within computational notebooks environments to enable new interactive analysis workflows.
Gos is released under the MIT License and available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The source code is publically available on GitHub (https://github.com/gosling-lang/gos), and documentation with examples can be found at https://gosling-lang.github.io/gos.
